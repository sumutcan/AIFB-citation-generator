  abstract = {Web services will transform the web from a collection of information into a distributed computational device. In order to employ their full potential, appropriate description means for web services need to be developed. For this purpose, we define a fully-fledged Web Service Modeling Framework (WSMF) that provides the appropriate conceptual model for developing and describing web services and their composition (complex web services). In a nutshell, its philosophy is based on the following principle: maximal de-coupling complemented by a scalable mediation service.},

@article{motta03,
	abstract = {In this paper we describe IRS?II (Internet Reasoning Service) a framework and implemented infrastructure, whose main goal is to support the publication, location, composition and execution of heterogeneous web services, augmented with semantic descriptions of their functionalities. IRS?II has three main classes of features which distinguish it from other work on semantic web services. Firstly, it supports one-click publishing of standalone software: IRS?II automatically creates the appropriate wrappers, given pointers to the standalone code. Secondly, it explicitly distinguishes between tasks (what to do) and methods (how to achieve tasks) and as a result supports capability-driven service invocation; flexible mappings between services and problem specifications; and dynamic, knowledge-based service selection. Finally, IRS?II services are web service compatible ? standard web services can be trivially published through the IRS?II and any IRS?II service automatically appears as a standard web service to other web service infrastructures. In the paper we illustrate the main functionalities of IRS?II through a scenario involving a distributed application in the healthcare domain.},

@article{VerborghSteinerEtAl13mtaa,
	abstract = {Many have left their footprints on the field of semantic {RESTful} Web service description. Albeit some of the propositions are even {W3C} Recommendations, none of the proposed standards could gain significant adoption with Web service providers. Some approaches were supposedly too complex and verbose, others were considered not {RESTful}, and some failed to reach a significant majority of {API} providers for a combination of the reasons above. While we neither have the silver bullet for universal Web service description, with this paper, we want to suggest a lightweight approach called {RESTdesc.} It expresses the semantics of Web services by pre- and postconditions in simple N3 rules, and integrates existing standards and conventions such as Link headers, {HTTP} {OPTIONS}, and {URI} templates for discovery and interaction. This approach keeps the complexity to a minimum, yet still enables service descriptions with full semantic expressiveness. A sample implementation on the topic of multimedia Web services verifies the effectiveness of our approach.},
